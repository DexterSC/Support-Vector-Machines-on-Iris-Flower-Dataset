# Support Vector Machines on Iris Flower Dataset

This project applies Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify species in the famous Iris flower dataset. The dataset includes measurements of iris flowers and their associated species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The project was completed as part of [Jose Portilla's Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/).
